# Mint's Sign Up Page Clone #

This project is a clone of **Mint.com's** Sign Up page using **html** and **css**.

In this project I demonstrated my **html form markup** skills as well as 
my ability to **style** these html form widgets using **css** as well.

I did this project as part of The Odin Projects [curriculum](https://www.theodinproject.com/courses/html5-and-css3/lessons/html-forms).
